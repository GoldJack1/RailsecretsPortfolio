This information helps improve app stability and performance.\n\n\n\n**1.1 - Local Data Storage:**\n\nThe app allows you to import data (e.g., station visits and ticket data) from files on your device. All imported data remains solely on your device and is not transmitted or shared externally by the app. However, imported data can appear on your other devices via the widget functionality provided by Apple's ecosystem.\n\n\n\n**2.
